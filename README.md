## Project Name 
reimagining-horision 
* Reimagine the Horiseon Hame Page by Refactoring

## Project Description

* The homepage of Horiseon is currently not meeting accessibility standards or search engine optimization. 
* My goal is to refactor the Horiseon homepage code to make it accessible while improving the search engine optimization. 
    * I refactored the existing HTML and CSS code without changing what the code does. 
    * The technology I used for refactoring the code in this project includes: VSCode. 
    * The code to evaluate includes CSS and HTML.
    **Note**: Failed to include file commit history on GitHub as the repo was stored in the wrong location on my computer originally. Commits were made to my GitLab 01-HTML Homework File in error.
